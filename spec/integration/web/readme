Per Travic CI system requirements, when writing selenium based rspec test cases for Admin-UI, the test case code should
wait until the page element has been rendered. The code should follow the following pattern:

begin
    Selenium::WebDriver::Wait.new(:timeout => 5).until do
        # Write a boolean expression as a test body
    end
rescue Selenium::WebDriver::Error::TimeoutError
end
# Re-do the test using rspec style expectations, this will help to provide more detail information in case the test is failed.
expect(....).to eq(...)


Please refer to the "it has a title" test case in spec/integration/web/admin_spec.rb as an example.
